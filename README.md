# gene2promoter

The script is for getting promoter (2k upstream) of all at genes in At genome.

need to `gunzip` all the gz files before excuting the script

`*multi.py` is for the genome file with multiple lines for each chromosome, the one download from ensembl.

however, the genome file in gz is already get rid of the multi-line problem. so there is no need to run the `*multi.py` script.
